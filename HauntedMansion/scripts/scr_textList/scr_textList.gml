	case 0:
		return "Thanks for helping me calm down. I can only imagine what Martha would’ve said if she saw what I’d turn into. I hope she found a way to keep going when I didn’t come home. Damn Mortimer, the rich fool. His ghost still haunts this place, you know. I’ll bet he had his life handed to him, never had to work for an education like the rest of us. To never have to worry about where your next meal is coming from and STILL treat your money like it’s all that matters...I don’t care too much about the treasure you’re after, but I’ll help in any way I can if it means hitting that bastard where it hurts.";
		break;
	case 1:
		return "My wife. Love of my life. The only reason I ever had that would actually motivate me to get out and make something of myself. She encouraged me to pursue my education and a career as a chef, but I hate that I could never take care of her the way I wanted. Even with me working all night at this place, she still had to pick up hours as a cleaner so we could keep a roof over our heads. Mind you, I’ve never thought women all have to be mothers and housekeepers, but I hate that she had no choice but to work because I couldn’t cut it. I hope she found somebody after me...someone who would treat her right.";
		break;
	case 2:
		return "Mortimer Rathborn, the damned fool that owned this mansion, and my employer. His wife, Helen, left him because he cheated on her. Well, she left him for a million reasons, but the last straw was when proof of his infidelity, little Elizabeth, started living here. Mortimer blamed everything and everyone but himself for his problems, and he took her leaving real hard. The man went on rampages throughout the house, breaking things and screaming and hurting himself. Most of the staff wouldn’t put up with it and left, but some fools, like me, wound up stuck here right up until he set the whole house on fire in one of his outbursts. When you die, I don’t recommend going out in fire...it’s not a good way to go.";
		break;
	case 3:
		return "My job here was never meant to be a long-term thing. I was working as a basic cook under the head chef to pay for my culinary classes. When the head chef had enough of Mortimer’s abuse and left, though, I suddenly became the new one in charge of the kitchen with all the money that came with it. *sigh* I should’ve left, too, but I just...I was so blinded by what all that money could do for me and Martha. I couldn’t give up that kind of pay. Lot of good that wound up doing me...";
		break;
	//Maid
	case 4:
		return "I’ve spent so long here, just stuck in a loop of my daily duties. I’ve no idea what year it even is right now. My poor children, they’ve been alone without me for so long! I...I wonder if they’re even still ok. I can’t believe I wound up HERE, of all places, stuck even in death with that boorish womanizer. *Sigh* I know there was really no other choice for me, but looking back it just seems like I should have...I don’t know, should have been able to do…SOMETHING to get out of this place. All of this is that man’s fault, and I’ll see the only thing he cares about ruined before I can move on. I’ll have my revenge.";
		break;
	case 5:
		return "My daughter, Nina, and my son Milo. They’re 8 and 5, respectively. Or...I suppose they used to be. I’ve no idea how old they must be by now or where they wound up. I don’t...I don’t even know if they’d remember me at this point, or remember me well. *Sob* I was only here for them. I thought if I could just hold onto this job, I could provide for them. Ramsey, the cook, even let me sneak home the leftovers from meals to help feed them. The very thing that was supposed to allow me to raise them is the reason they were left without any parents.";
		break;
	case 6:
		return "Mortimer Rathborn, the damned master of the house. The man chased any skirt he happened to pass by, including mine, and it caused most of his problems. His wife, Helen, left when he took in one of the children from his affairs. It’s a marvel to me that the woman put up with him as long as she did before that, or that she ever married him in the first place. That was what pushed Mortimer over the edge, though, and he was even worse than his usual self afterwards. He brought it on himself, of course, but good luck to anyone trying to convince him of that. The man likes to blame anyone and everything except himself for his problems, and those of us that worked for him paid the price for it.";
		break;
	case 7:
		return "The man ruined everything I ever cared about. Even when we were alive, he barely paid me enough to feed myself and my kids in exchange for me working my fingers to the bone to meet his inexhaustible demands. I’ll never forgive him, as long as I li...er, I’ll just never forgive him. If you’re after his money, I’ll help you as much as I can. There’s nothing else left to take from him, but the man’s so attached to his money it’s even kept his spirit here. Taking it from him is the only thing that can still hurt him.";
		break;
	//Child
	case 8:
		return "Thanks for helping me find my stuff, I can’t believe I’d lost it for so long! I know it’s just stuff, but it means a lot to me. It helped me get away and feel safe whenever Papa got really grumpy. That’s all most people ever saw of him, but I promise, Papa was a good person too! It’s just...he gets angry sometimes, especially since the lady left. I know he still loved me, but he’d get so sad when he looked at me after that. I think I looked too much like my Mommy. ";
		break;
	case 9:
		return "My Dad. More-tee-mur. He’s big and scary now, but he wasn’t always like that. He used to be so happy, and I think he loved my Mom, too. I’m not sure why he said we couldn’t see her any more, but he said I had to come with him. He bought me lots of things and always took care of me...until he started that fire, anyway. But it was an accident! He wouldn’t have hurt me on purpose! He couldn’t have! Papa loves me, he just...he just didn’t know how to use his words to tell everyone what was wrong.";
		break;
	case 10:
		return "The one Papa said was going to be my new Mom, but I don’t know why I needed a new one. I think her name was...Hell in? Helen, that was it. She never liked me. She didn’t say it, but she seemed so grumpy any time she looked at me, and then they would yell at each other for a long time. I tried to ride my trike somewhere else or go play with Goldilocks, but I could still hear them. She left real soon after I got here. I think Papa was upset with me for making her leave, but I didn’t do it on purpose! I know I made her mad somehow, I must have done something wrong, but no one would tell me what I did.";
		break;
	case 11:
		return "My Mom! She was sooo pretty! I always wanted to look just like her when I grew up! She lived far away from here, on the other side of the ocean. She never had much money, and I was hungry a lot with her, but she always smiled around me just like in my picture! I remember her crying when I got on the boat with Papa, I don’t know why she didn’t just come with us. I thought I made her happy, but I must have done something wrong if she didn’t want me. Papa wouldn’t tell me what I did, either. I miss her every day.";
