Damn Mortimer, the rich fool. His ghost still haunts this\nplace, you know. I’ll bet he had his life handed to him, never had to work for an education like the rest of us. To never\nhave to worry about where your next meal is coming from and STILL treat your money like it’s all that matters...I\ndon’t care too much about the treasure you’re after, but I’ll help in any way I can if it means hitting that bastard where\nit hurts.";

She encouraged me to pursue my education and a career as a chef, but I hate that I could never take care of\nher the way I wanted. Even with me working all night at this place, she still had to pick up hours as a cleaner so we\ncould keep a roof over our heads. Mind you, I’ve never thought women all have to be mothers and housekeepers, but\nI hate that she had no choice but to work because I couldn’t cut it. I hope she found somebody\nafter me...someone who would treat her right.";

Well, she left him for a million reasons, but the last straw was when proof of his infidelity, little\nElizabeth, started living here. Mortimer blamed everything and everyone but himself for his problems, and he took her\nleaving real hard. The man went on rampages throughout the house, breaking things and screaming and hurting himself.\nMost of the staff wouldn’t put up with it and left, but some fools, like me, wound up stuck here right up until he set\nthe whole house on fire in one of his outbursts. When you die, I don’t recommend going out in fire...it’s not a good\nway to go.";

		return "My job here was never meant to be a long-term thing. I was working as a basic cook under the head chef to pay for my\nculinary classes. When the head chef had enough of Mortimer’s abuse and left, though, I suddenly became the new one\nin charge of the kitchen with all the money that came with it. *sigh* I should’ve left, too, but I just...I was so blinded by\nwhat all that money could do for me and Martha. I couldn’t give up that kind of pay. Lot of good that wound up doing\nme…";
